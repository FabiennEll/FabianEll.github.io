            Everyone has their way to deal with hardship. I can see this very clearly in my family. My Mom - she wants to make sure everyone is okay, so she rarely shows negative emotion clearly. (I mean - I have known her for a while now so I know when she’s not happy, but I feel like she’s trying to hide it).She only ever lets her feelings flow when she’s in private and retreated. My Dad feels very responsible too, he tries his best to sympathize and help me and my brothers through difficult situations. My big brother just closes up, shuts himself in and bottles up all the negativity. From the outside it might look like he’s just in a bad mood or annoyed. On the rare occasions his emotions show, it’s through anger and shouting. I can’t recall having seen him cry in at least 8 years. My little brother acts most similarly to me: he cries.
            </p>
            <p>
            So that’s where we are - me:
            </p>
            <p>
            I cry, and I cry a lot. I think my negative emotions are best described with a generic picture: a brooding storm.
            </p>

            It starts out as a few clouds. Nothing special. Just clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
            But over time, there are more clouds accumulating. And more. And more.
            </p>
            <p>
            That’s the point where I do one of two things, if not both. Either I try to distract myself through meaningless things: YouTube. Video Games. Social Media. Sometimes it does a good job of hiding away the pain. Still, I would advise no one to go down this route. <strong>You’re not getting rid of the feelings, you’re just trying to ignore them.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            The other thing I do is hiding away. I guess I try to avoid further negative stimuli, but this just leaves me alone and anxious, stuck in my own, bad, thoughts.
            </p>
            <p>
            When I’m doing these things, the figurative clouds grow to quite the thunderstorm (if not a hurricane).
            </p>
            <p>
            Then it’s really just a matter of time, until I start crying.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>So i told you what not to do - what should you do then? </em>
            </p>
            <p>
            There is no universal truth in any mental health matter. My advice is just to allow your feelings. They will come eventually, so you might as well try to be in control of when (kind of at least), how and where. Go somewhere where you feel safe and protected. If you have someone you can and want to talk to, that’s good. If you want to be alone, that’s good too. Do what’s best for you.
            </p>
            <p>
            Have a good one.
